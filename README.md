This repository provides the implementation of SkySplat, a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for sparse-view satellite image reconstruction.
SkySplat has been accepted by AAAI 2026.

## ✨ Overview

SkySplat addresses multi-temporal sparse-view satellite reconstruction by integrating the RPC camera model into a generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **RPC-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting** for satellite-specific geometric modeling.
 
- **Self-supervised learning** with radiometric-robust relative height supervision (no ground-truth labels required)
 
- **Efficient inference**, achieving up to 86× speedup over per-scene optimization methods (e.g., EOGS)

## 📊 Results
<p align="center"> <img src="paper/fig1.jpg" width="100%" alt="Results"> </p>

- **Strong performanceDFC19**: MAE reduced from 13.18 m → 1.80 m with 3.19s!

- **Strong generalization**: consistent performance on MVS3D benchmark

## ⚙️ Setup
Before training, modify the dataset path in:
```
config/experiment/re10k.yaml
```

Then update:
```
dataset:
  roots: /path/to/your/dataset
```

## 🏋️ Training

Run training with:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m src.main +experiment=re10k data_loader.train.batch_size=1
```

## 🚀 Inference

Run evaluation on a trained checkpoint:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m src.main +experiment=re10k checkpointing.load=Path_ckpt mode=test
```

## 📁 Dataset

SkySplat is trained exclusively on the public US3D dataset, including the following subsets:
```
JAX-Extra, JAX-Train, JAX-Val
OMA-Extra, OMA-Train, OMA-Val
```
The dataset is publicly available at:

👉 https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/urban-semantic-3d-dataset

## 🛠️ Dataset Preparation (CreateDataset)

SkySplat provides an official dataset preparation script under:
```
SkySplat-main/CreateDataset
```
The pipeline (adapted from SatelliteSfM) crops 2048×2048 multi-view satellite tiles into 256×256 samples and generates ```image/, height/, rpc/, cameras/, and cameras_others/```, which are directly compatible with SkySplat.
```
Example
python satellite_sfm_crop2048to256.py \
  --input_folder ./CreatDataset/example/input2048 \
  --output_folder ./CreatDataset/example/output256
```
For detailed usage and examples, please refer to SkySplat-main/CreateDataset/README.md.

## 🛰️ RPC camera models Processing (Important)

SkySplat relies on RPC camera models for satellite image geometry.
To convert RPC imagery into pinhole-hole camera representations, we follow the pipeline from:

👉 https://github.com/Kai-46/SatelliteSfM

This process generates:

```
dataset/
├── cameras/
├── cameras_others/
```

These camera files are required for training and inference.

## 📐 Optional: Depth Projection

If depth maps need to be generated from height maps, projection can be performed using camera geometry from the RPC-to-pinhole conversion step.

## 📝 TODO
In the coming period, we plan to release the following resources to facilitate easier testing and debugging of SkySplat:
- ✅ **Dataset generation code with a sample dataset.**  
  We have released the official dataset preparation scripts along with one example dataset to help users understand the data format and generation process.
